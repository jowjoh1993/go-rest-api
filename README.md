# REST API for Events

This project was completed as a part of [Go - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide).

## Purpose

This REST API will expose endpoints for CRUD operations on events (e.g. meetings, sporting events, etc.), creating and authenticating users, and for registering users to events.
